- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure that my code is function and secure in the future, rigours testing will be needed to achieve that standard. While obviously no kind of testing will be 100% flawless and cover every single minor aspect of the program, being able to cover around 98-99% of scenarios will be my goal.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
For this part I usually conduct an initial intake meeting regoarding the users specific needs for the program and take various notes on what they want implemented. I also follow this with constant interaction with the client/user to make sure that there is nothing I missed or that they want added after the initial meeting.

- How do I approach designing software?
